              When I discovered Neocities and the old web, and seeing all the
              amazing websites people were doing, I decided to make my own. The
              site is mainly themed after the Kirby franchise, but I also
              showcase other of my interests. It's also a place for me to create
              fun things and share it with others. I hope you enjoy my website
              and if you liked it, you can sign my Guestbook ! You can find my
              button and other cool websites in the Miscellaneous section :D

                  >frutigeraeroarchive</a
                >
                if you want to check them out, I will leave the one on this site
                as it is.

                <strong>14/03/2025</strong>
                Started work on a new page on Anime reviews.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>13/03/2025</strong>
                Adapted my website for 1080p screen height, in contrary to 19:10
                as previously.

                <strong>11/03/2025</strong>
                Returned back to the old logo, I got very nostalgic looking back
                at earlier versions and I think it was iconic. I also fixed
                stuff on my tribute pages and the links in the navbar will no
                longer open new windows, since I think it is a bit annoying.
                Also changed the font from Arial to Roboto. <br />Part 2: I
                added songs back to the favorite games section! This used to be
                a feature in some of the earliest versions of this website. I
                also added Mass Effect 3 there, as I forgot to add it.<br />
                Part 3: Changed the colors and theme of everything! The borders
                are slimmer, buttons look aero, I will work on polishing the new
                look next.

                <strong>03/03/2025</strong>
                A new random plays on each different pages now, instead of the
                same one.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>28/02/2025</strong>
                Made the logo and text be an image instead. Re-opened sketchbook
                submissions. I will start working again on this site soon.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>17/01/2025</strong>
                I stopped using iFrames for the layout, i'm now using HTML again
                for the navigation, i figured out a way to keep the navbar music
                playing across different pages using cookies.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>13/01/2025</strong>
                Added some links and fixed some incorrect information in the
                Coding Tricks section. I also added a few of my artworks and
                sketchbook drawings that i didn't add before.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>03/01/2025</strong>
                Happy new year, everyone ! I'm taking a break from updating this
                site for an indeterminate amount of time, as I'm working on the
                <a href="https://frutigeraeroarchive.org/" target="_blank"
                  >Frutiger Aero Archive</a
                >. So don't be surprised if I don't add your drawings in
                Sketchbook, I will, eventually.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>09/12/2024</strong>
                Added more drawings, and corrected typos from all over the site,
                there were a lot ! Also, Chrismas Theme.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>09/11/2024</strong>
                Made a new section called Coding Tricks, where I'm going to put
                some tips and tricks on coding that I've learned while making
                this website and other projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>05/11/2024</strong>
                Made the sketchbook section a lot cleaner, added titles, and
                fixed the broken form.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>30/10/2024</strong>
                Added many new songs to the navbar music player.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>29/10/2024</strong>
                I made an "Artworks" section where I showcase my drawings /
                digital art.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>27/10/2024</strong>
                The website is now a single page application (SPA), using
                iframes (because of the limitations of Neocities, I can't use a
                framework like React to do this), which means no more loading
                screens when changing page. To do this, I sadly had to remove
                the sitemap section, because it can't link to pages outside
                itself anymore. I also changed the navbar music player, there is
                now a playlist of songs, this is done with JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>19/10/2024</strong>
                Added back the CRT Television section with the small TV, because
                i missed it. Also worked on my Frutiger Aero tribute a bit.
                Thanks for all your drawings that you guys sent me in the
                sketchbook ! I really appreciate it, and they're beautiful.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>30/08/2024</strong>
                I uploaded the Frutiger Archive on a new website instead of
                hosting it on this one, because it's going to be too big to just
                be a tribute page hosted here. You can follow it at
                <a href="https://neocities.org/site/frutigeraeroarchive"
                  >this link</a
                >. I also added a link to it on the navbar.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>29/08/2024</strong>
                Hello again ! Sorry for the lack of updates, I have been a bit
                busy. Anyway, I'm working on a
                <a href="https://frutigeraeroarchive.neocities.org/"
                  >Frutiger Aero Archive</a
                >, feel free to take a look, I'm nowhere near done. I'm not sure
                yet if it's going to become its own website or if I'll keep it
                hosted on here. Thanks for the comments on the guestbook and all
                the people that sent me their drawings which look very cool.

                <strong>09/07/2024</strong>
                I added 177 buttons to the Miscellaneous section, and organized
                it better.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>07/07/2024</strong>
                I just noticed I accidentally removed the custom songs for each
                section, it was just one song playing, so that's fixed now. I
                also made the CRT TV better with power LED's and more 3D look
                with gradients.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>05/07/2024</strong>
                Changed the icons in the navbar to be more Kirby themed and
                cleaner.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>04/07/2024</strong>
                I decided to remove the old CRT section because I did not like
                having 2 of the same thing and I felt like it was not as good as
                the new one (previously called Realistic CRT, now CRT
                Television). But now that I got some space there, I will
                probably start working on new sections, I have some ideas
                already. Just need to get it done.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>02/07/2024</strong>
                Added back the sheep, but now you have to click the button in
                the navigation bar to spawn one (or multiple). I will also make
                the GIF section better soon, since I have not really changed it
                since I made it. Part 2: Improved the Realistic CRT page and
                fixed some bugs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>30/06/2024</strong>
                Added the ability to pause the Kirby following the mouse by
                clicking on him, and added
                <a href="https://adrianotiger.github.io/web-esheep/">Esheep</a>
                because I find it entertaining. Part 2: I removed it because it
                didn't work properly on phones, but I might use it later, maybe.
                I added a link to my Neocities profile in the navbar in the form
                of a button.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>27/06/2024</strong>
                Remade my About Me section by adding / changing some text and
                added silly GIFs and images where there was nothing previously.
                Also added images elsewhere. Part 2: Greatly improved
                responsiveness on phones, the page now works in portrait mode
                except for some sections with huge content (Music Player, CRT
                TV, Sketchbook), it also looks good on 800x600 resolution now.
              </p>

                <strong>25/06/2024</strong>
                I've set up a custom domain name, it changes from
                daniele63.neocities.org, to daniele63.com, but the old URL will
                still redirect to the new one. You can do this by buying a
                domain name with a service like Namecheap, then, you need to go
                to Neocities > Account settings > Manage Site Settings > Custom
                Domain, put your custom domain name there that you bought, and
                then add the "A record" and "AAAA record" in your domain name
                provider, usually the option is located in advanced DNS, also
                remove the default redirect if there's one.

                <strong>24/06/2024</strong>
                I made the Sitemap section a lot nicer, adding descriptions of
                each links and a layout more in line with the rest of the
                website. Part 2: I added a lot of decorative buttons in the
                Miscellaneous section.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>23/06/2024</strong>
                Made each section have a unique music, I will maybe change them
                later, but I think it's pretty cool. Part 2: I added a view
                counter to the bottom of this page, you can do this using the
                Neocities API and a bit of JavaScript, you can find a tutorial
                <a href="https://dannarchy.com/tut/tut_002">here</a>.

                <strong>22/06/2024</strong>
                Since I had to fix a lot of the CSS because of the sanitize.css
                thing, I took the opportunity to also make the rest of the CSS
                files less bloated and more organized. I don't know if this
                helps load speeds or not, but I saved 2 Kilobytes (did you know
                Super Mario Bros only weighs 31 Kilobytes ?). Do I have an
                obsession with optimization ? Maybe.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>21/06/2024</strong>Previously, I had problems with my
                navbar and other elements having different heights in other
                browsers/devices. I finally fixed this by using this
                <a href="https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/"
                  >CSS library</a
                >
                that makes the CSS "reset" from the default values and basically
                be the same on every browser. I also fixed my Kirby Games
                section that was kind of glitched and had a lot of repeated
                code, i basically removed 500 lines of useless code in that CSS
                file.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>19/06/2024</strong>I made a sitemap section (a list of
                all the links of my website). I also added text in site info and
                moved the "embed my button" thing to the Miscellaneous section.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>18/06/2024</strong>I made a sidebar on the right, with
                different ads on it that I think look cool. Because of this, i
                also had to resize certain sections so that they stayed
                responsive, so the CRT and music player got a bit smaller. I
                also added buttons in the arcade section to toggle things on /
                off. Part 2: Improved the Arcade Games section by removing games
                that did not work and adding others (FNF, Tetris, Super Mario
                Bros), I also changed the way the buttons look and added a scan
                line filter on the iframe.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>17/06/2024</strong>I changed the website logo and also
                added a music player to the navbar, with a song for each
                section. Part 2: I changed text around the website, added more,
                and so on. Maybe will do a blog section later ? I wonder. I
                don't have much to talk about, so I will think about it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>15/06/2024</strong>Made navbar more compact and changed
                almost all icons. I've changed my button a bit, feel free to
                update it if you have not hot linked.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>14/06/2024</strong>Had to remove some Naruto songs in
                Music Player that didn't work anymore (that's an issue with
                embedding YouTube videos). I also added Ocarina of Time songs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>12/06/2024</strong>I greatly improved responsiveness
                across different sizes, the page should now stay in the middle
                even on a bigger screen. Part 2: You can now use my website and
                realistic CRT without JavaScript enabled, with some interactive
                features disabled, however. Part 3: I no longer hotlink any
                buttons (that is, having buttons images linked from people's
                websites, instead of being hosted on my own), I also added a
                bunch of new buttons and removed some that did not work anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>10/06/2024</strong>I made my page different HTML files
                instead of one as before because I noticed it was getting really
                slow to load and you basically had to download the whole website
                before being able to use it so, it's now divided in different
                files and also different CSS and JavaScript files. Because of
                that we lost the ability to hear the music player on other
                pages, but i think it's not that big of a deal.

                <strong>09/06/2024</strong>Another Tribute Page, this time for
                WALL-E, my favorite animated movie from Pixar, took a few days
                to make and I don't really have time to make it look perfect at
                the moment, but I might improve it later.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>04/06/2024</strong>I made a >Minecraft Tribute website,
                inspiration struck me at 4AM and I finished it the day after.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>01/06/2024</strong>I made the website appear bigger as
                it should be (I was on 125% dpi before, and I changed to 100%).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>26/05/2024</strong>Huge update! I made the website a bit

                <strong>23/08/2022</strong>Hi I'm back ! I haven't uploaded in a
                while because I was burnt-out with programming (or rather
                learning React.JS). It felt like a chore, not something I
                enjoyed.<br />
                So I took a break. <br />I took interest in Photography again
                and had a lot of fun photographing things. Now I want to go back
                to programming but turn it into my passion as well, not just
                something I want to learn to get a job someday.<br />
                Because you're only going to get good at something if you enjoy
                it. Thanks to everyone that supported me on Neocities and for
                the unbelievable amount of views, I'm truly grateful and humbled
                by it.<br />
                Let me know what you'd like to see on this website, I'm thinking
                of a making a blog, but I don't know if anyone cares. I'm kind
                of running out of ideas on what to add, haha. Anyway, thanks for
                all. Update 2: Compressed almost all the images on the website,
                which should load up faster now. Added a Monster Hunter Tri
                song.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>12/07/2022</strong>Added a newly announced Kirby Game in
                my Kirby Games section. No big updates for now, but I have some
                ideas.
              </p>
              <p><strong>10/07/2022</strong>Improved the Archive page.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>09/07/2022</strong>Improved the Fav Games and Kirby
                Games section. Thank you so much for 20,000 views !
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>08/07/2022</strong>I fixed the awful theme and added new
                favorite games. I also added 6 new songs: from Pokémon, the
                English Kirby Opening theme and a Mario 64 song. Update 2: Even
                more Pokémon songs added !
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>03/07/2022</strong>Hello again, I have not updated in a
                while as I'm learning new things in programming. I gave the site
                a more blue background and changed a few things around.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>23/06/2022</strong>Changed a lot of icons and changed
                the header text to yellow. I removed Coding Tricks from the
                navbar because I prefer to focus on other parts of the website
                and it felt too different.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>20/06/2022</strong>Added a new section ! You can now
                look at the history of all Kirby Games through the years, from
                Game Boy to Switch. Thanks to Nintendo Fandom Wiki for the text.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>16/06/2022</strong>Made the table in CRT Television
                Section bigger. I also added links in "This Website" and
                centered About Me image.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>15/06/2022</strong>I changed the color of the UI to
                light blue instead of white, added Mario Party DS and MH TRI to
                my Favorite Games, and made the playlist text darker in the
                Music Player.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>14/06/2022</strong>Changed Music Player UI a bit. 2 New
                songs: Zelda Wind Waker theme, King Dedede's Theme [Brawl]
                theme.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>13/06/2022</strong>I'm back, I was sick with the
                coronavirus (still is, but I feel way better), so I didn't feel
                like working on this site. I may start working on it again.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>29/05/2022</strong>New music player section ! It's
                inspired by a Winamp skin based on Kirby.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>27/05/2022</strong>I changed some text in many sections.

              <p>
                <strong>26/05/2022</strong>For copyright reasons I removed the
                local MP3 files and replaced them with YouTube embedded videos
                because I think it's not allowed otherwise. I will make it look
                better later. You can now add your own videos to the Television
                by putting the end of a YouTube link.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                <strong>21/05/2022</strong>Added 2 other games to my favorite
                games section and improved some things. The CRT shouldn't be
                glitched on tablets now.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>20/05/2022</strong>Added 2 games to my favorite games
